## 0 Repository Structure

The typical explanation for the repo structure. Lab specific instructions can be
found further below.

### 0.1 HW

The `hw` folder should contain your schematic and board files for your PCB or
circuits. In labs 1-5 and 10, you will be creating schematics for your circuit
in EAGLE. A setup tutorial can be found
[here](https://www.shawnvictor.net/autodesk-eagle.html).

### 0.2 SW

The `sw` folder should contain your application firmware and software written
for the lab. The `sw/inc` folder contains firmware drivers written for you by
Professor Valvano. Feel free to write your own (in fact, in some labs, you may
be required to write your own).

You can place any other source files in the `sw` folder. TAs will look at the
files you create and/or modify for software quality and for running your
project.

### 0.3 Resources

A couple files are provided in the Resources folder so you don't have to keep
searching for that one TI document. Some of them are immediately useful, like
the TM4C datasheet. Others may be useful for your final project, like the
TM4C_System_Design_Guidelines page.

### 0.4 Git and Github

We will extensively use Git and Github for managing lab projects. This makes it
easier for TAs to grade and help debug the project by allowing us to see commit
histories, maintain a common project structure, and likewise, it makes it easier
for students to collaborate with partners, merge different codebases, and to
debug their work by having a history of commits.

Two common ways of using Git and Github are [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and the [command line](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
[Tutorials](https://dev.to/mollynem/git-github--workflow-fundamentals-5496) are also abundant on the net for you to peruse. We've provided a cheatsheet for git
in the Resources folder.

It is highly recommended to make the most out of Git, even if you've never used
it before. Version control will save you a lot of suffering, and tools like Git
or SVN are ubiquitous in the industry.

A gitignore file is added to the root of this repo that may prevent specific
files from being tagged to the repo. This are typically autogenerated output
files we don't care about, but sometimes other stuff (like .lib files) falls
through that we want. Feel free to modify if necessary.

### 1.5 Background

Considering the design cycle presented in Section 1.3 of the book, one starts by analyzing a problem, and then one generates a **requirements document** describing what the system must do. The output of the analysis phase is a list of specifications and constraints. The requirements document for Lab 6 is given in [`requirements_document.docx`](requirements_document.docx). The Preparation and Procedure sections of lab assignments address the design and implementation phases of the project. The lab assignment and your solution to it represents analysis and initial design, just part way through the design cycle in Figure 6.5. You will build no circuits and write no software.

As you know, commercial products are not manufactured using solder-less breadboards like the ones we use in ECE319K and ECE445L. Furthermore, commercial products do not include microcontroller boards like the LaunchPad. Implementing the embedded system on a PCB, which includes both the microcontroller and the external circuitry, will improve maintainability, testability, and reliability. It will also reduce the size, weight and cost of the system.

There are no specific requirements for this lab to minimize size, cost, or power, but you will be asked to estimate these parameters in your system. There are three considerations when designing a power efficient system. First, we need to make a **Power Budget**. This means we determine the maximum amount of power that can be supported by the power source. Second, we need to identify and analyze required **system tasks**. This means we determine the tasks that need to be performed by the system and estimate the power required to perform these tasks. It is important to consider timing of the tasks and synchronization to I/O events. For example, executing about once a second (e.g. smoke detector checking for fires) will require less power than executing exactly once a second (digital watch). One way the TI MSP430 family achieves very low power is it can run without a crystal oscillator, and the rate at which the microcontroller runs can be approximately set. For example, the 40-pin MSP430F2274 running at 1 MHz requires only 400 µA of supply current, whereas a Cortex M requires 10 to 100 times more current. The third consideration is to develop a **power strategy**. Having a strategy for power helps the power needed to perform the required system tasks to fit within the power budget. A Power Budget is a first order calculation that gives you a ballpark figure of the “total average current” supported by your power source. From the system specifications we are given how long the system must operate without replacing batteries, **tlife** (hours) (tlife is 24 hours in this lab). From the battery datasheet we determine the storage capacity of the battery, **E** (mAh). Be aware that for many batteries the storage capacity also depends on current, time, and temperature.

For this lab, the power budget is: **average current ≤ E / tlife**
- E = 2600mAh
- tlife = 24h

## 3 Procedure

*Note: every part in your system must be added to a BOM (bill of materials)*

### 3.1 Select an Enclosure for the System

1. Your PCB must fit within an enclosure
2. A larger box will allow for a larger PCB and make layout simpler
3. Select an enclosure from the following list (these enclosures can be found in the ECE445L parts chest):

   | Enclosure     | Manufacturer                  | Datasheet                                                                   |
   |---------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Hammond 1593Y | Hammond Manufacturing         | [Hammond 1593Y datasheet](resources/enclosure_datasheets/hammond-1593Y.pdf) |
   | PacTec XP     | PacTec                        | [PacTec XP datasheet](resources/enclosure_datasheets/pactec-XP.pdf)         |
   | Serpac 151    | Serpac Electronic Enclosures  | [Serpac 151 datasheet](resources/enclosure_datasheets/serpac-151.pdf)       |

4. During checkout, you will have to verify that your PCB fits inside of the enclosure that you selected
   
### 3.2 Complete the Schematic

> TODO: decide between through hole resistors, capacitors, etc
> if we go with SMD, they can look on JLC for the prices

1. Add the DAC and op-amp to the schematic

### 3.3 Complete the PCB

1. Resize the PCB area so that it corresponds to the enclosure that you selected
2. Place the components within the PCB area
   1. You cannot use auto-place functions
   2. All components must be placed by hand
   3. Intelligently placing your parts will make laying the traces much easier in the future
   4. Place components in a way to minimize trace lengths and cross-talk
   5. Place components that connect to each other next to each other
   6. If possible, place polarized parts in the same orientation
3. Route the components on your PCB 
   1. You cannot use auto-route functions
   2. All traces must be routed by hand
4. Execute a **Design Rules Check (DRC)** and fix any errors that exist

### 3.4 Enter Your PCB into JLCPCB

1. Click the **CAM Processor** button in the top tool bar
2. Select **Export as ZIP**
3. Click the **Process Job** button
4. Save the zip file
5. Go to [jlcpcb.com](https://jlcpcb.com/)
6. Click the **Add gerber file** button
7. Select the zip file
8. Click the **Instant Quote** button
9. Take a screenshot of the screen for the report
   1.  If the PCB is smaller than 10000 mm<sup>2</sup> the calculated price will be $2.00
   2.  If the PCB is larger than 10000 mm<sup>2</sup> the calculated price will be greater than $2.00

### 3.5 Complete the BOM

1. Export your parts list from Eagle
   1. Click **File**
   2. Click **Export...**
   3. Click **BOM**
   4. Select csv as the file format
   5. The delimiter for the csv file from Eagle is `;` (which makes no sense because csv stands for: *comma-separated values*)
   6. Convert the csv's delimiter to `,` with the [eagle_bom_to_csv.py](resources/bom/eagle_bom_to_csv.py) script
      1. In windows, type `py eagle_bom_to_csv.py -h` to view the script's help function
      2. In ubuntu, type `python3 eagle_bom_to_csv.py -h` to view the script's help function
      3. If you have another way you'd prefer to convert your csv's delimiter, feel free to do that
2. Add your enclosure to the BOM
3. Add any additional parts to your BOM that your system will contain (batteries, etc)
4. Add a column for **price**
5. Add a column for **estimated current draw**
6. Fill out the **price** column with values found from:
   1. [lab6_parts.csv](resources/bom/lab6_parts.csv)
   2. [digikey](https://digikey.com/)
   3. [mouser](https://mouser.com/)
   4. [octopart](https://octopart.com/)
7. Fill out the **estimated current draw** column with values collected from your parts' datasheets
8. Calculate the total cost of the system
9. Calculate the estimated total current draw of the system
10. Calculate how long the system can operate using the estimated total current

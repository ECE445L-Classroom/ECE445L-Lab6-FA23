## 0 Repository Structure

The typical explanation for the repo structure. Lab specific instructions can be
found further below.

### 0.1 HW

The `hw` folder should contain your schematic and board files for your PCB or
circuits. In labs 1-5 and 10, you will be creating schematics for your circuit
in EAGLE. A setup tutorial can be found
[here](https://www.shawnvictor.net/autodesk-eagle.html).

### 0.2 SW

The `sw` folder should contain your application firmware and software written
for the lab. The `sw/inc` folder contains firmware drivers written for you by
Professor Valvano. Feel free to write your own (in fact, in some labs, you may
be required to write your own).

You can place any other source files in the `sw` folder. TAs will look at the
files you create and/or modify for software quality and for running your
project.

### 0.3 Resources

A couple files are provided in the Resources folder so you don't have to keep
searching for that one TI document. Some of them are immediately useful, like
the TM4C datasheet. Others may be useful for your final project, like the
TM4C_System_Design_Guidelines page.

### 0.4 Git and Github

We will extensively use Git and Github for managing lab projects. This makes it
easier for TAs to grade and help debug the project by allowing us to see commit
histories, maintain a common project structure, and likewise, it makes it easier
for students to collaborate with partners, merge different codebases, and to
debug their work by having a history of commits.

Two common ways of using Git and Github are [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and the [command line](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
[Tutorials](https://dev.to/mollynem/git-github--workflow-fundamentals-5496) are also abundant on the net for you to peruse. We've provided a cheatsheet for git
in the Resources folder.

It is highly recommended to make the most out of Git, even if you've never used
it before. Version control will save you a lot of suffering, and tools like Git
or SVN are ubiquitous in the industry.

A gitignore file is added to the root of this repo that may prevent specific
files from being tagged to the repo. This are typically autogenerated output
files we don't care about, but sometimes other stuff (like .lib files) falls
through that we want. Feel free to modify if necessary.

## 2 Preparation
1. Download the `EE445L.lbr` file to make sure you have the latest version (the GitHub should contain the latest version)
2. Receive the part number for your assigned DAC and op-amp from your TA
3. Find the datasheets for the DAC and op-amp

> TODO: add datasheets in table

4. Find the availability and prices for the DAC and op-amp
5. Find the symbols and footprints for the DAC and op-amp

> TODO: add table of symbols and footprints for the DAC and op-amp

6. Add the DAC and op-amp to the Lab 6 schematic
   1. You do not have to finish the schematic
   2. You do not have to add additional functionality beyond what is in the requirements document

## 3 Procedure

*Note: every part in your system must be added to a BOM (bill of materials)*

> TODO: discuss rewriting the BOM.xlsx

### 3.1 Select an Enclosure for the System

1. Your PCB must fit within an enclosure
2. A larger box will allow for a larger PCB and make layout simpler
3. Select an enclosure from the following list (these enclosures can be in the ECE445L parts chest):

| Enclosure     | Manufacturer                  | Datasheet                                                                             |
|-----------    |-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Hammond 1593Y | Hammond Manufacturing         | [Hammond 1593Y datasheet](resources/enclosure_datasheets/hammond-1593Y_datasheet.pdf) |
| PacTec XP     | PacTec                        | [PacTec XP datasheet](resources/enclosure_datasheets/pactec-XP_datasheet.pdf)         |
| Serpac 151    | Serpac Electronic Enclosures  | [Serpac 151 datasheet](resources/enclosure_datasheets/serpac-151_datasheet.pdf)       |

4. Add the enclosure to your BOM
5. During checkout, you will have to verify that your PCB fits inside of the enclosure that you selected
   
### 3.2 Complete the Schematic

> TODO: decide between through hole resistors, capacitors, etc
> if we go with SMD, they can look on JLC for the prices

1. 

### 3.3 Complete the PCB

1. Route the parts on your PCB 
   1. You cannot use 


### 3.4 Order Your PCB From JLCPCB

1. 


### 3.5 Complete the BOM

1. Export your parts list from Eagle
   1. Click `File`
   2. Click `Export...`
   3. Click `BOM`
   4. Select csv as the file format
   5. The delimiter for the BOM from Eagle is `;`
   6. Convert the csv's delimiter to `,` with the [eagle_bom_to_csv.py](resources/bom/eagle_bom_to_csv.py) script
      1. In windows, type `py eagle_bom_to_csv.py -h` to view the script's help function
      2. In ubuntu, type `python3 eagle_bom_to_csv.py -h` to view the script's help function
   7. Add a column for **price**
   8. Add a column for **estimated current draw**
   9. Fill out the **estimated current draw** column with values collected from your parts' datasheets
   10. Calculate the total cost of the system
   11. Calculate the estimated total current draw of the system
   12. Calculate how long the system can operate using the estimated total current
